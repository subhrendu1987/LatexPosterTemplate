% Rendering LogicalFallacies infographics as 4xA4 pages PDF which can be
% printed on normal printer and glued together. Before processing download
% http://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/pdf/LogicalFallaciesInfographic_A1.pdf
% and put in the same directory as this file. Then try
%
%    pdflatex logical_fallacies_for_a4.tex
%
% (but read below for possible margin tuning). After printing cut part
% of the margins and glue together.

% Calculation notes
%
% Original image (A1 version) has no margins and is 
%     2383.94 x 1683.78 pts
% (as for example pdfinfo promptly shows)
% Quarter of it has size
%     1191.97 x 841.89 pts
% (and the same values denote mid-point of the image so appear below as 
%  border points)
%
% A4 landscape page is 297 mm x 210 mm =  842 pt x 595 pt. Therefore
% A4 page minus margin (which we here assume to be 28pt) is
%   (842 - 2 * 28) x (595 - 2 * 28) pt =   786 * 539 pt
%
% Therefore the scaling ratios necessary to fit the image are:
% (horizontal) 786 / 1191.97 = 0.6594...
% (vertical)   539 / 841.89 = 0.6402...
% To avoid skewing we take smaller of those, 0.64 (slightly rounding)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Page margin
\newcommand{\pagemargin}{1mm} % about 1 cm, in points to make calcs easier

% Scaling factor (see above how to calculate it with respect to margin)
\newcommand{\scalingfactor}{.98}
\newcommand{\filename}{conference_poster_4.pdf}
